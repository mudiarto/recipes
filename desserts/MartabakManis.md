  5. Heat the skillet until the heat is even, about 350f even & constant
  6. Put some butter in the skillet & smears them
  7. Put about 0.3 of the dough (about 4 big ladle) in the skillet
  8. Using the ladle, move it around the wall of the skillet and put a bit of dough there, to create the 'crispy wall'
  9. Cover the skillet - wait for couple minutes, until the cake is done (no more liquidy)
  10. Take the cake to your cooking board. 
  11. If you still have some dough left, spawn a new process to bake the cake (step 5 - 11)
  12. Smear some more butter in the inside of the cake
  13. Smear some sweetened condensed milk in the inside of the cake as well
  14. Get creative here - combine the filling and fill half the cake
